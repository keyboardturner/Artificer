[Full Changelog & Previous Releases](https://github.com/keyboardturner/Artificer/releases)

# 0.0.4

Added new option to automatically collapse the Buff bar button (this was insanely prone to taint in almost every other iteration, it has the stability of tert-Butyllithium left alone in a room of air)

Reworked the "Account Settings" checkboxes into dropdown menus. These now consist of 3 options: None, Account-wide on, and Account-wide off.

Auto loot should no longer be enabled account wide by default.
