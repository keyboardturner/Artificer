# Artificer

This addon aims to bring a variety of little niche options and features. These are all basically individual "tweak" settings, CVars, or addons that never felt like they could be full standalone projects. So my experimental projects essentially get placed in to here in this "workshop" of sorts.

It has the following options:
 - Fish Reel In: Plays a reel-in sound when your fishing cast finishes.
 - Hide Crafting Results: Hide the Crafting Results frame when opening a profession tradeskill frame and crafting an item
 - Chromie Time Icon: Displays an icon on the map indicating if you're in Chromie Time (Timewalking Campaigns).
 - Hide Action Button Macro Text: Hides the macro text on Action Bar buttons.
 - Transmog Outfit Borders: Display borders on transmog outfits that are placed on the action bar buttons.
 - Allow Arrow Keys in Chat Editbox: Allow using the arrow keys to move the cursor in the chat editbox without needing to press alt.
 - Server Notification Raid Warnings: Display Server Notifications (such as realm restarts) displayed as a Raid Warning.
 - Move Addon Compartment Frame: Moves the Addon Compartment Frame to the top of the calendar button instead of the bottom.
 - Minimap Icon: Displays clickable icon button on Minimap to open settings.
 - Automatically Accept Party Sync: Automatically accept the Party Sync confirm button when it is prompted.
 - Movable Currency Transfer: Allows the Currency Transfer window to be moved.
 - Outfit Swap Sounds: Select which sounds to mute during outfit changes.
 - Account Auto Loot: Enforces Auto Loot to be enabled on every character.
 - Account Pet Battle Map Filter: Enforces Pet Battle Map Filter to be disabled on every character.
 - Account Cooldown Manager Enabled: Enforces the Cooldown Manager to be enabled on every character.
 - Show All Minimap Trackables: Toggle additional minimap tracking options.
 - Weather Density: Control the weather density / intensity.
 - Auto Push Spells to Action Bars: Whether spells should automatically be placed on your action bars.

It also has the following features:
 - Cancel Aura Manager: Automatically remove specific buffs out of combat.
 - Abandon Quest Manager: Automatically remove specific quests you don't want to accept.
 - Outfit Sound Manager: Configure gear movement sounds that can play for each outfit.

The main project can be accessed with a minimap button, the addon compartment frame, or via slash commands /artificer or /arti.
